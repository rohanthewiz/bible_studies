- Never seen an ape lauch a missle from sea level to hit satellite
 (geo-static) orbiting and 7k miles and hour
 that's 3 times faster than a Lockheed Blackbird

### 2:1-3 Rest [A Call to health]
- New Testament makes it clear that Christians are not required to observe the Sabbath

- Preacher's Commentary - "That is part of what rest means; to be at His place, 
	at His time, doing the thing He planned for us to do, confident in His strength and resources..."
- God finished working - do we take time to enjoy completeness.
- Rest in deligation - Preacher's comentary: "Those who find the rest of God are those who discover
 the strategy of God, submit to His timing for events, and appropriate the resources God provides,
  refusing to fall to the temptation of distrusting or judging the capabilities of others. The job gets done;
  we can put down the tools; we can enjoy the sabbath rest"
  - Tim 6 . Richly gives us all things to enjoy
  - [Ecc 3:12-13 NIV] 12 I know that there is nothing better for people than to be happy and to do good while they live.

   - [1Ti 6:17 CSB] 17 Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant or to set their hope
    on the uncertainty of wealth, but on God, who richly provides us with all things to enjoy.

##  Tips for Interpretting Scripture - Learn by repetition - I will be going over these
- Network - Scripture explains scripture - Correlation
- Use the Observation technique - Problem solving is about 80% observation
- Do NOT jump to an early conclusion before considering all the pieces
- Weigh scripture - apply good, sound (healthy) logic
- Put things in their proper place
	- Illustration of the Mona Lisa - Black and White
- Figure scope - not everything applies to everyone - Deut 14:21, 23:20
- Get to the main line
- If your donkey falls into a pit, pull it out - [doh!] - [Luk 14:5 NKJV] 5 Then He answered them, saying,
 "Which of you, having a donkey or an ox that has fallen into a pit, will not immediately pull him out on the Sabbath day?"
